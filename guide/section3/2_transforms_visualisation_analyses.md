## Transforms

Graph transformation is a central concept in Graphia. Transforms are a range of processes by which a graph is modified to produce a new graph or calculate a new attribute. Graphia incorporates a wide range of options that allow an analyst to perform a sophisticated range of data transformations and analyses. These include processes such as graph clustering, edge reduction, node/edge filtering based on attributes, calculation of graph metrics or algorithms that change the structure of a graph. Graphia's interface for performing graph transforms has been designed to be powerful and flexible, the results immediately modifying a graph's structure or appearance.

The **Add Transform** button can be found in the top right of the graph view. From here a list of transforms can be selected (see below).

Active transforms are displayed in a list on the top right of the graph display. Transforms are applied top down; the transform at the top of the list is applied first, the results of which are then fed into the second transform and so on down the list. The result of this process is what is ultimately displayed.

<div class="caption">Transform list showing three active transforms. Click on the selector icon to display options for modifying a transform (right). The order in which transforms are applied can be adjusted by clicking and dragging the selector icon. Transforms can be pinned to the bottom of the list in the case where you always want a transform to be applied last.</div>

Clicking **Add Transform** will bring up the following dialog:

<div class="caption">The cluster dialog providing the means to select clustering algorithm and granularity setting.</div>

From here you are presented with a list of all transforms available, separated by category. Clicking on a transform from the list will display a list of options as well as a brief description of the transform.

- Attributes provides a means to modify or add new attributes based on existing attributes in the graph
- Clustering provides options for clustering a graph
- Edge reduction provides a means to globally reduce the number of edges in a graph
- Filters provides options to remove or keep elements based on their associated attributes
- Metrics includes a number of algorithms to analyse the positional characteristics of elements in a graph
- Structural includes a range of algorithms that will change the structure of a graph, based on defined criteria

Some transforms provide the option to automatically apply a visualisation after adding. Clicking OK will finalise the transform and add it to the Graph. We describe some of the most commonly used transforms below. 

## Clustering

Clustering is the act of dividing a graph up into groups of nodes, which are referred to as clusters, based on their position within the overall topology of the graph. Clustering seeks to divide the graph into communities where nodes likely possess similar properties or characteristics. Graphia incorporates two of the most widely used algorithms for performing this analysis, the Markov Clustering (MCL) and Louvain clustering algorithms. Both include the option to change the granularity of clustering, i.e. how many clusters are formed. There is no simple answer to the question of what the correct clustering of a graph is, but good visualisation allows one to look at the results of a cluster analysis and how it maps on to a graph's structure. Once data has been clustered, clusters can be analysed by enrichment analysis to see if there are any node attributes over-represented within the groups. 

## Edge Reduction

In some graphs the number of edges can be exceptionally large. Not only can these be difficult to render, they may add little to the overall structure and can actually obscure higher level groupings. The k-nearest neighbours (k-NN) algorithm is widely used for globally reducing the number of edges in a graph, such that a given node has a maximum number of edges. In a weighted edge graph it is preferential to retain those with the strongest weights. A modification of this principle is to retain only a given percent of the edges for any given node (%-NN). In the case where there are no edge attributes available there is also the option to remove a homogenous sample of the edges (Edge Reduction transform).

## Filters

The filter transforms allows a user to remove nodes or edges based on their attributes. It provides a functionally rich menu with which to transform a graph based a wide range of criteria.

## Metrics
Graphia includes three metrics for analysing a graphs structure:
- Betweenness centrality is a measure of centrality in a graph based on the shortest paths between nodes. The betweeness centrality is the number of these shortest paths that pass through the node.
- Eccentricity calculates the shortest path between every node and assigns the longest path length found for each node. This is a measure of a node's position within the overall graph structure. 
- PageRank is an algorithm used originally to measure the importance of website pages. PageRank works by counting the number and quality of links to a page to determine a rough estimate of how important a node is.

C-D are continuous attributes, so colour spectrum and size used for display. Betweenness and eccentricity are calculated for both nodes and edges and therefore visual encoding is applied to both.</div>

## Visualisation of Attribute Information

Visualisations are another important concept. Associated with nodes and edges are various attributes. This information may have been loaded from the input file or calculated in the application itself. Visualisations are often tied to the output of Transforms; for example a clustering transform will automatically apply a colour visualisation, so each cluster is coloured differently.

Clicking **Add Visualisation** (bottom right of graph display window) will open the Add Visualisation dialog.

<div class="caption">Visualisation dialog. First select the node or edge attribute you wish to visualise and then how you wish to display this (colour, size, text)</div>

Visualisations can be one of the following types:

- **Colour** - For text based attributes this will apply a unique colour to each distinct attribute value. Numerical values will be displayed as a colour range or gradient.
- **Size** - This will scale elements to match the range of the attribute's values.
- **Text** - This will display the attribute value as text in the graph. The visibility of graph text can be changed via View â†’ Show Node/Edge Text. The font and size of text can be adjusted in the Options dialog.

Visualisations operate in a list, similarly to how Transforms work. Visualisations update to match the data in the graph.

<div class="caption">Visualisation list containing two visualisations. MCL Cluster attribute as a colour visualisation and Edge betweenness attribute as a size visualisation.</div>

In the case of categorical attributes each attribute is assigned a colour, numerical attributes are displayed using a spectrum of colour. Clicking on the colour key of a visualisation will allow you to change the colour scheme of the whole palette or the colour assigned to individual attributes.

Each visualisation operates within its domain and does not interfere with other visualisations of a different type, for example a colour visualisation will not interfere with a text visualisation. However two visualisations of the same type will overlap, with the last visualisation in the list taking precedence. Multiple visualisations of the same type can be in the same list without overlapping, assuming they apply to separate graph elements.
